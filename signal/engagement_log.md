| 2026-04-11 | Kirubel | r/LocalLLaMA | u/matt-k-wong asking about model size | Clarified: Llama 3.3 70B via Groq. Explained structured docs (tables + code) outperform prose even at 70B -- same info as prose failed injection test, as table passed immediately. Invited comparison across param counts. | [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1siqbda/i_kept_running_into_cases_where_retrieval_was/) |

| 2026-04-14 | Kirubel (KG) | Hugging Face #general | **5-message practitioner exchange with user H$Go (8:52 PM - 9:49 PM EAT)**. Opened with cross-DB join question framed against DAB; H$Go pushed back on the multi-DB premise. Walked H$Go through: DAB inherited-environment framing → 38% ceiling → MCP Discovery & Routing as the real hard part → agent-driven pattern detection + normalization codegen → KB Injection Testing as automated test gate (21/21 on sub-8B) → **Level 1 (Functional) vs Level 2 (Semantic / 0-rows-no-error) failure framing**. H$Go's "fuzzy AI" join suggestion validated our Correction Layer direction. First substantive Discord conversation of the project. | https://discord.com/channels/879548962464493619/879548962464493622/1493670392236212416 |

| 2026-04-16 | Kirubel | r/SQL | Reply to B1zmark | Agreed this is fundamentally a business-rule/data-contract issue and clarified the normalization boundary for mixed-store agent workflows. | [reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/1smzvar/cross_database_join_keys_are_a_silent_failure/ogi0f6r/) |
| 2026-04-16 | Kirubel | r/SQL | Reply to Eleventhousand | Agreed one-db/app-layer stitching is common for owned systems, and clarified our case spans systems we do not own so normalization happens before join resolution. | [reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/1smzvar/cross_database_join_keys_are_a_silent_failure/ogi3a0a/) |
| 2026-04-16 | Kirubel | r/SQL | Reply to Imaginary__Bar | Acknowledged the business-rule core and clarified our claim is about detectability in multi-store agent execution (valid run, zero rows, no exception). | [reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/1smzvar/comment/ogivon3/) |
| 2026-04-16 | Kirubel | r/SQL | Reply to Wise-Jury-4037 | Clarified we do not treat generic id fields as self-joinable across stores and anchored the response in Q023 plus explicit key mapping + correction patterns. | [reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/1smzvar/comment/ogjbf4q/) |
| 2026-04-16 | Kirubel | r/SQL | Reply to B1zmark (transformation-layer follow-up) | Acknowledged Spark/medallion for owned batch pipelines and clarified why runtime normalization is kept in-path for benchmark-time cross-store detectability. | [reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/1smzvar/comment/ogjbtak/) |
| 2026-04-16 | Kirubel | r/SQL | Reply to Wise-Jury-4037 (joinability + 3+ sources) | Clarified joinability is explicit via per-entity contracts and that 3+ source joins are handled as staged, validated pairwise merges with visible correction on low-coverage/empty stages. | [reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/1smzvar/comment/ogjvi04/) |

| 2026-04-18| Meseret| r/learnmachinelearning |Your AI agent is matching words, not understanding questions| Reply from u/Cybyss -to pushback distinguishing general LLM paraphrase robustness from agent-layer wording sensitivity. Clarified that routing, schema interpretation, and context selection are the brittle layers — not the model itself. Referenced testing across llama-3.1-8b and larger OpenRouter models.|[reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1sonxrg/comment/oguhcp8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

| 2026-04-18| Meseret| r/SQL| Post by u/Ambitious-Hornet-841: Cross-database join keys are a silent failure mode in multi-database agents: Cross-database join keys are a silent failure mode in multi-database agents | I replied-Reframed the problem as a data contract issue rather than a query problem. Recommended a dedicated join key resolver that runs before query generation and holds normalisation rules per entity type deterministically. Argued query layer is less painful than ETL only when resolution logic is explicit and outside the model. Added the distinction between "zero rows returned" and "query failed" as separate failure modes requiring different correction paths.| [reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/1smzvar/comment/ogucszt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

| 2026-04-11 | r/MachineLearning | Posting blocked: account too new or karma too low for r/MachineLearning. Pivoted to r/learnmachinelearning | Adjusted community targeting. r/learnmachinelearning has lower barrier, still relevant audience. Will build karma for r/MachineLearning access in Week 9. |
| 2026-04-11 | u/matt-k-wong (r/LocalLLaMA) | Validated "longer docs = lower quality" as universal LLM property; linked our injection test approach to Karpathy's wiki thesis | Reinforced Mikias's table-heavy, Q&A-anchored KB format; 21/21 injection test pass on llama-3.1-8b-instant (Apr 12) is a direct outcome |
| 2026-04-13 | DAB official channels (GitHub + leaderboard site) | No official DAB Discord exists. UC Berkeley EPIC Lab + Hasura PromptQL route community through GitHub issues only | Cohort community strategy redirected to Hugging Face / EleutherAI / LlamaIndex Discords per Practitioner Manual guidance. Three Discords joined. |
| ~~2026-04-13~~ | ~~u/Far-Comparison-9745 (r/learnmachinelearning)~~ | ~~REMOVED: This was Kirubel's own second Reddit account, not external community engagement~~ | -- |
| 2026-04-13 | @matanzutta on X (replied to Kirubel's Domain Knowledge Trap reply under @ashpreetbedi/Dash v2) | "the gap between what the schema says and what the business actually means is where most agent queries go wrong" — verbatim restatement of our Domain Knowledge thesis from a non-coordinated practitioner | **Strongest external validation in portfolio so far.** Confirms our framing lands with practitioners outside the cohort. Cite in final engagement summary and Week 9 X content. |
| 2026-04-14 | u/This-You-2737 (r/learnmachinelearning) | Replied to own join-failures post recommending Great Expectations + Scaylor Orchestrate as pipeline-validation tools | Reinforces our positioning of KB injection testing as agent-native alternative to pipeline-side validation. Validates the problem is well-understood; the agent-native solution path is the differentiator. |
| 2026-04-14 | H$Go (Hugging Face Discord #general, ~57 min thread) | Initial pushback on multi-DB premise → after DAB framing, suggested "fuzzy AI" matching as the way to handle ID mismatches → asked about test verification | **3rd external practitioner validation.** H$Go's "fuzzy AI" suggestion arrived independently at our Correction Layer architecture (agent-driven pattern detection + normalization codegen). Confirms the Discovery & Routing framing resonates. Closing exchange introduced **Level 1 (Functional) vs Level 2 (Semantic) failure** vocabulary — promising frame for Article B and benchmark thread. |
